The contact form UI is ready but needs backend integration. To make it functional:

1. Sign up at [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io) (free tier available)
2. Create a new form and get your form endpoint
3. Update the form in `app/page.tsx`:

```tsx
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
```

Alternative services: Netlify Forms, Basin, FormSubmit

## 🌐 Deployment to Namecheap

1. Run `npm run build` to generate the `out/` folder
2. Upload contents of the `out/` folder to your public_html directory via FTP/cPanel
3. Ensure `.htaccess` is configured for proper routing (if needed)
