export const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "How much does therapy cost?",
    answer: "Individual therapy sessions are $150 per hour. Many insurance plans are accepted, and I can provide a superbill for out-of-network reimbursement."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you accept insurance?",
    answer: "Yes, I accept most major insurance plans including Aetna, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Cigna, and UnitedHealthcare. I recommend contacting your insurance provider to verify coverage for out-of-network providers. I can provide detailed invoices for reimbursement."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens in the first session?",
    answer: "The first session is about getting to know each other. We'll discuss what brings you to therapy, your goals, and your history. I'll explain my approach and answer any questions you have. There's no pressure—this is a space for you to explore whether we're a good fit."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does therapy typically last?",
    answer: "This varies greatly depending on your goals and needs. Some clients find relief in 8-12 sessions, while others benefit from longer-term support. We'll regularly check in on your progress and adjust as needed. You're always in control of your therapeutic journey."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer online/telehealth sessions?",
    answer: "Yes! I offer secure video sessions through a HIPAA-compliant platform. Many clients prefer the convenience and comfort of meeting from home. Online sessions are just as effective as in-person for most therapeutic work."
  },
  {
    question: "Is therapy confidential?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Everything you share is confidential and protected by law (HIPAA). The only exceptions are if you're at risk of harming yourself or others, or if there's suspected child or elder abuse—in which case I'm legally required to take action to ensure safety."
  },
  {
    question: "What's your cancellation policy?",
    answer: "I require 24 hours notice for cancellations. Late cancellations or no-shows may be charged the full session fee, as that time was reserved exclusively for you. Life happens though—let's talk if you're facing circumstances beyond your control."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if therapy is right for me?",
    answer: "If you're feeling stuck, struggling with emotions, or wanting to understand yourself better, therapy can help. You don't need to be in crisis. The best time to start is when you notice you could benefit from support. Take the Therapy Fit Quiz to learn more about what might work for you."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm not sure what type of therapy I need?",
    answer: "That's completely normal! Our first session is a chance to explore together. I'll help you identify your needs and recommend approaches that fit your situation. You can also take the 2-minute Therapy Fit Quiz on this site to get personalized recommendations."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I schedule my first session?",
    answer: "Use the contact form on this site or call me at +1 (414) 617-2201. I'll respond within 24 hours to discuss your needs and find a time that works for you. You can also email Gina@wccounseling.net if that's easier."
