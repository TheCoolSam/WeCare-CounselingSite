## 🚀 Quick Setup (Before Going Live)

### 1. **Activate Contact Form (5 minutes)**

The form is ready but needs a Formspree account:

1. Go to **https://formspree.io/** and create a free account
2. Create a new form and get your Form ID
3. Open `app/page.tsx` and find line ~825:
   ```tsx
   // TODO: Replace 'YOUR_FORM_ID' with your actual Formspree form ID
   const response = await fetch('https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID', {
   ```
4. Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual ID (looks like `xwkyabcd`)
5. **That's it!** Form submissions will now go to your email.

**Alternative Form Services (if you prefer):**

- **Netlify Forms**: Free, works automatically if deployed on Netlify
- **FormSubmit**: https://formsubmit.co/ (no signup required, just use an email)
- **SendGrid/Mailgun**: For custom email integration

---

### 2. **Add Real Photos (High Priority!)**

The critic rated "No Real Photography" as the **#1 CRITICAL issue**.

**What to do:**

1. Get a professional headshot of Gina (warm smile, professional setting)
2. Save it as `public/gina-headshot.jpg`
3. Open `app/page.tsx` and find line ~159 (About Section):
   ```tsx
   <div className="aspect-[4/5] bg-gradient-to-br from-sage-100 to-sage-200...">
     <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center...">
       <div className="text-center">
         <div className="text-8xl font-bold mb-4">GB</div>
         <p className="text-sm px-6 text-sage-700">
           Professional photo coming soon
         </p>
       </div>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```
4. Replace with:
   ```tsx
   <div className="aspect-[4/5] bg-gradient-to-br from-sage-100 to-sage-200 rounded-3xl shadow-2xl overflow-hidden">
     <img
       src="/gina-headshot.jpg"
       alt="Gina Botshtein, LCSW - Licensed Clinical Social Worker"
       className="w-full h-full object-cover"
     />
   </div>
   ```

**Photo Guidelines:**

- Professional but approachable (not too corporate)
- Natural lighting preferred
- Eye contact with camera (builds trust)
- Neutral/outdoor background
- High resolution (at least 800x1000px)

---

### 3. **Add Real Testimonials (High Priority!)**

The critic rated this the **#2 CRITICAL issue**.

**Current placeholder testimonials are at line ~465 in `app/page.tsx`:**

```tsx
const testimonials = [
  {
    quote: "Working with Gina helped me finally address my anxiety...",
    author: "Sarah M.",
    type: "Individual Therapy Client",
    rating: 5,
  },
  // ... 3 more placeholders
];
```

**What to do:**

1. Reach out to past clients (with their consent)
2. Ask for written testimonials or use existing reviews
3. Replace the placeholder quotes with real ones
4. Use first name + last initial only (e.g., "Jennifer K.")
5. Keep the 5-star ratings (adjust if needed)

**Legal Note:** Make sure you have written consent from clients to use their testimonials, even anonymized ones. The disclaimer at the bottom of the testimonials section covers HIPAA concerns.

---

### 4. **Update Contact Information (Before Launch!)**

**Phone & Email Placeholders:**

- Current: `(123) 456-7890` and `gina@wecare-counseling.com`
- These appear in 3 places:
  1. Contact section (form page)
  2. Footer
  3. Hero CTA button (phone link)

**Find & Replace in `app/page.tsx`:**

- Search: `tel:+1234567890` → Replace with: `tel:+1YOURNUMBER` (no spaces/dashes)
- Search: `(123) 456-7890` → Replace with: Your formatted number
- Search: `gina@wecare-counseling.com` → Replace with: Real email

---

### 5. **Insurance Verification (Optional but Recommended)**

In the Pricing section (line ~285), we list:

- Aetna
- Blue Cross Blue Shield
- Cigna
- UnitedHealthcare

**Action:** Verify which insurance plans Gina actually accepts and update the list accordingly.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Form not working after adding Formspree ID?

- Check the browser console for errors
- Verify the Form ID is correct (should be 8-10 characters)
- Test form submission on Formspree dashboard

### Testimonials look different after adding real ones?

- Keep quotes under 150 words for best layout
- Use the same format: quote, author, type, rating

### Photos not showing up?

- Make sure images are in the `public/` folder
- Reference them without "public" in the path: `/image.jpg` not `/public/image.jpg`
- Check file extensions match (`.jpg` vs `.jpeg` vs `.png`)
